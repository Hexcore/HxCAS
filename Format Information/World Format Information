The world data files are stored as a caw file: Cellular Automaton World file.

The first line has 2 numbers: x and y.
x == the number of columns the matrix has.
y == the number of rows the matrix has.

The next line has a single character, either T, H or R.
T|t == triangle grid world.
H|h == hexagon grid world.
R|r == rectangle grid world.

Next follows y blocks of information. Each block has x number of lines.
The lines each have the following format:
n v1 v2 ... vn
n == the number of values to follow for the specific cell.
v1 v2 ... vn == the n values of the specific cell.

Example:
2 3
t
1 0
1 1

1 2
2 3 4

1 5
1 6
makes the following triangle grid:
[ 0 ][ 1 ]
[ 2 ][3 4]
[ 5 ][ 6 ]
